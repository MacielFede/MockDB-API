# MockDB-API

The porpouse of this project was to learn a bit about the 
differents operations we can do with the fetch API in JavaScript.

The database where all the users are registered it's a mock database
from https://mockapi.io/ .

Escentially we can do 4 operations:

- Search users: Indicating the ID of the users the app will search for it in the DB.
    If there's no ID indicated, it will display a list of all the users registered at the time.
- Create a new user: Creates a new user in the DB with an automatic ID, the firstname and lastname
    are indicated by the user.
- Modify an existing user: Modifies the firstname, the lastname or both of a certain user indicated by it's ID.
- Delete of a user: Deletes from the DB the user indicated by it's ID.
