# MockDB-API

The objective of this project was to learn a little about the
different operations we can do with the fetch API in JavaScript.

The database where all users are registered is a simulated database.
from https://mockapi.io/.

Essentially we can do 4 operations:

- Search for users: Indicating the user's ID, the app will search for it in the database.
    If no ID is specified, it will display a list of all currently registered users.
- Create a new user: Create a new user in the database with an automatic ID, name and surname
    are indicated by the user.
- Modify an existing user: Modify the name, surname or both of a specific user indicated by their ID.
- Deleting a user: Deletes the user indicated by their ID from the database.
